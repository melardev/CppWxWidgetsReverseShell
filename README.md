# Introduction
Reverse Shell written in C++ with wxWidget framework, for more Reverse Shell and/or Bind Shell implementations
written in other programming languages and frameworks check out my Github page.

# Getting started
This project was created with Visual Studio and using wxWidgets installed by vcpkg which I strongly
recommend, it will download wxWidgets for you, and build it on your system, and make Visual Studio to
detect it automatically without any additional configuration.
Vcpkg in case you don't know is an awesome cross platform C++ package manager.
